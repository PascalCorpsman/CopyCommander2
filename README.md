## What needs to be done to compile CopyCommander2

To be able to compile the code you need the [Lazarus-IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org)

Inside Lazarus you need to install the following packages:
- L-Net from [almindor](https://github.com/almindor/lnet) or [PascalCorpsman](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/lnet) use the online Packagemanager to install (recomended to use the PascalCorpsman version)


## Direct download link (not always the newest version)

If you do not have Lazarus you can directly download a precompiled binary [from](https://www.corpsman.de/klickcounter.php?url=download/copycommander.zip).
